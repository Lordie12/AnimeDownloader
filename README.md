-python modules use are; Beautifulsoup, selenium, pySmartDL, configparser, pip
note: these modules should auto install if you have pip installed which is installed by default on python 3.4 and up on windows


The script may work on other platforms, but has been tested on windows 7 and windows 10, Mac.

Note: I don't have a Mac computer so I am unable to test further versions of the script
Note: This works best with your default player set to flash, and auto play turned off

For Mac users change the config file destination to look like 
```
destination = /Users/HomeUser/Desktop/
```
